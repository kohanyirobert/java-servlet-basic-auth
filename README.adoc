= Java Servlet Basic Auth

This is a demonstration of a web-application that protects pages/resources with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication[HTTP Basic Auth].

It consists of a

* http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/Filter.html[Filter],
* and a http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/Servlet.html[Servlet].

== Filter

Intercepts requests to

* `/basic` -- `../basic`
* `/basic/*` -- `../basic/index`, `../basic/link`
* `/basic/**` -- `../basic/error.html`

*Allows* intercepted requests to pass-through the filter that contains a valid username/password combination the required HTTP headers (as mandated by the HTTP Basic Auth specification).

*Denies* intercepted requests otherwise.

== Servlet

* `/` loads `index.html` which isn't protected.
* `/basic` redirects to `/basic/index`.
* `/basic/index` returns the contents of `basic/index.html`,
* `/basic/link` returns the contents of `basic/link.html`.
* `/basic/<anything>` returns the contents of `basic/error.html`.

IMPORTANT: Please note, that the contents of the HTML files are _loaded_, returned in the response -- no _redirect_ happens.
